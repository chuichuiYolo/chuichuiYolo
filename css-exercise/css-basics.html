    <h1 >Chapter 1: Introduction</h1>
    <p id="first" class="myclass">
      Urbanisation has become an imperative force 
across the world as the populations of many cities 
grow larger than the total population of many small 
nations. A major problem with these cities is that 
their growth has been so rapid and uncontrolled, 
particularly in recent decades, that it has outstripped 
the capacity of urban administrations and their 
infrastructure services to meet the physical and 
social needs of people who live in them. Children 
form an important part and large category of people 
who live in cities—yet they are a demographic 
group that is often ignored in planning our cities. 
Urbanisation has significant implications on the 
growth and development of children especially in 
a country like India, which has 472 million children 
(0–18 years) comprising of 39% of the country’s total 
population. </p >  

<p id="first" class="myclass">
  While India is home to the world’s largest population 
of children, the overall health of children in the 
country is a matter of great concern; out of the 27 
million children born each year in India, nearly 2 
million do not live to the age of 5. Over 40% of thechildren who do live till 5 are malnourished. </p >  
    
    <h2 >Chapter 2: Research methodology</h2>
    <p id="first"class="myclass"> 
      The compendium aims to better understand the need 
for engaging with children in the decision making 
process in cities through the various initiatives at 
multiple levels. The analysis complements existing 
knowledge on the subject and helps provide 
empirical learning of various stakeholders at the 
urban and national level for making successful 
programming and policy decisions. </p >

<p id="first"class="myclass"> 
  Recognising that children living in urban areas are 
at risk on various fronts due to inadequate support 
and lack of protection is crucial. The compendium 
therefore builds on the ample evidence from 
various global best practices, that if children and 
young people are actively informed and involved 
in responding to the challenges in the urban 
enviornment they are a part of, it yields benefits not 
only for their own learning and development, but 
also for the energy, resourcefulness and knowledge 
that they can bring on local issues. </p >

<p id="first"class="myclass"> 
  The compendium adresses the need for community 
based organisations, urban local bodies and other 
public and private sector organisations that work 
with children–focused urban development, with 
an expectation that the findings will strengthen the 
effectiveness of programming around making cities 
more child friendly.The findings are also expected to 
enable organisations to engage more appropriately 
and effectively with children and young people. An 
underlying focus throughout the compendium has 
been on the role that local government institutions 
play in shaping and effectively implementing these 
initiatives in urban areas.</p >
    
    <h3>Chapter 3: Case studies</h3>
    <p id="first"class="myclass">
      To affirm the government’s commitment to the 
rights based approach in addressing the continuing 
and emerging challenges and needs of children, 
Government of India adopted the National Policy for 
Children, 2013, in continuation of the National Policy 
for Children, 1974, 2003, and the National Plan of 
Action for Children,1992. The 2013 policy reaffirms 
the government`s commitment to the realisation of 
the rights of all children in the country. It recognises 
every person below the age of 18 years as a 
child and that childhood is an integral part of life 
with a value of its own; it recognises that children 
are not a homogenous group and calls for a long 
term, sustainable, multi-sectoral, integrated and 
inclusive approach, necessary for the harmonious 
development and protection of children. </p >

<p id="first"class="myclass">
  For the first time children have been considered as 
stakeholders in the urban development framework. 
The Smart City Mission Statement and Guidelines 
recognise children as key stakeholders. The mission 
,which covers 100 cities, stipulates that consultation 
processes in cities need to take account of all 
citizens, including vulnerable sections of society 
like the differently-abled, children, elderly, women 
etc. Some smart city features outlined in the mission 
document that would have an impact on children 
include. </p >
