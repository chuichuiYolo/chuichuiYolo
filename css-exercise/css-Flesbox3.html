<h1>Background: Child Friendly Cities (CFC) Initiative</h1>
<div>
  <h2>Policy framework in the Indian context</h2>
  <p>
    Urbanisation has become an imperative force 
across the world as the populations of many cities 
grow larger than the total population of many small 
nations. A major problem with these cities is that 
their growth has been so rapid and uncontrolled, 
particularly in recent decades, that it has outstripped 
the capacity of urban administrations and their 
infrastructure services to meet the physical and 
social needs of people who live in them. Children 
form an important part and large category of people 
who live in cities—yet they are a demographic 
group that is often ignored in planning our cities. 
Urbanisation has significant implications on the 
growth and development of children especially in 
a country like India, which has 472 million children 
(0–18 years) comprising of 39% of the country’s total 
population. 
While India is home to the world’s largest population 
of children, the overall health of children in the 
country is a matter of great concern; out of the 27 
million children born each year in India, nearly 2 
million do not live to the age of 5. Over 40% of the 
children who do live till 5 are malnourished. 
According to a report by the World Bank on the 
prevalence of anaemia among children, 59% of 
Indian children under 5 years of age have anaemia. 
Half the children have reduced learning capacity 
because of iodine deficiency. Diarrhoea alone kills 
one child every minute in India—more than 1000 
children under 5 years of age die each day in India 
due to diarrhoea caused by lack of proper sanitation 
facilities. 63 million adolescent girls in India live in 
homes without proper toilet facilities—this means 
they are forced to defecate in the open at risk to their 
safety and lives.

  <h2> About the CFSC project</h2>
  <p>
    Given that children formulate a large and crucial 
    part of this growing population in cities, it becomes 
    relevant to look at their needs in a holistic manner 
    through urban planning and design. To advocate 
    child-friendly practices it is imperative to look 
    at issues such as appropriate safety standards, 
    guidelines on the quality of the built and spatial 
    environment, equal opportunities for the differentlyabled, children’s participation in decision making, 
    allocation of special children’s budgets and 
    convergence of various city agencies.
    National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) is 
    undertaking a programme on building Child Friendly 
    Smart Cities to promote policies and practices to 
    make Indian cities child friendly within the urban 
    agenda of building smart cities. NIUA has partnered 
    with the Bernard van Leer Foundation, a Dutch 
    grant making foundation, to develop a programme 
    of activities over the next three years, focusing on 
    interventions and advocacy related to addressing 
    children’s needs in cities in India. It is intended that 
    through this project, the needs of children and youth 
    are actively addressed within the urban framework.
    It is the first time an initiative like this, which looks 
    at children’s needs in a comprehensive manner 
    through the lens of urban planning and design 
    across four key theme areas (Public Health, Safety 
    and Security, Transportation/Mobility and Living 
    Conditions) is being taken up in the country. 
    Governance aspects across the key theme areas 
    are the underlying factor for greater convergence of 
    various agencies to address children’s needs.
    The key purpose of the project is to mainstream 
    the needs of young children in Indian cities by 
    addressing the gaps in urban planning. The main 
    objective of the project is to bring greater awareness 
    amongst urban planners and policy makers about 
    the interrelationship between a child’s health, built 
    environment and living conditions. The project 
    further aims to stimulate innovation and partnerships 
    between urban policy makers, urban planners, 
    architects, business leaders and NGOs to better 
    address and prioritise children’s needs around 
    issues such as housing, sanitation, education, 
    health, transportation, mobility, environment, leisure 
    and play etc, through practical and impactful 
    interventions.
    Initiatives under the Child Friendly Smart Cities 
    project include: 
    1Defining child friendly cities within the Indian 
    context and determining the scope of the project; 
    2 A detailed status of children in India report, 
    describing the state of children within India over 
    past decades across the key focus areas; 3 A 
    comprehensive compilation of best practices 
    globally within the scope of child–friendly cities, to 
    learn from innovative practices; 4Development 
    of active tools for intervention at neighbourhood, 
    municipality and city level for a more practical and 
    impactful spatial and urban planning, urban design 
    and policy framework.
