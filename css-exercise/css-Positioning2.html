  <h1>Main Activities</h1>
  <p>As a starting point, the government established 
    a child friendliness map through an extensive 
    environmental analysis, viewed from the perspective 
    of children and youth. This formed the basis for the 
    choice of a number of priority themes that were 
    explored in a perception survey of children and 
    young people. The process delivered challenges 
    and solutions leading to a local strategy on child 
    friendliness. 
    The Youth Ghent programme tries on a continuous 
    basis to question children and youth on all subjects 
    concerning their daily lives. The content of this 
    collected data is fed back and further developed 
    by young people through talks at various schools 
    and other organisations. This note was also shared 
    with the colleges and was inspirational in terms of 
    the layout of the administrative and later the multiannual plan.
    The Youth Council has been vital in collecting 
    pertinent information regarding areas where 
    interventions need to take place— spatial analysis, 
    social challenges, equipment required to carry out 
    the research— and then take action on the ground. 
    The council also cooperated with the city-wide 
    process for preparation of the strategic plan, in order 
    to develop and draft the multi-annual plan.
    Cooperation with Hogent: Children in Urban Rooms 
    (KIDS). This is a multidisciplinary applied research 
    around child-friendly urban planning in collaboration 
    with the city of Ghent. The project combines 
    design research in four pilot neighbourhoods in 
    Ghent with policy-oriented research which seeks 
    to include a place for children as co-investigators. 
    A learning network with representatives from the 
    various departments and cabinets is intended to be 
    established as part of this project.</p>
    <p>Essen is the ninth largest city in Germany. However, 
        conforming to the recent trend of negative population 
        growth in Germany, statistics show that only one out 
        of seven households in Essen has children. The city 
        has approximately 108,000 children under the age 
        of 18 years. Out of these, 22.6% live with a single 
        parent and 10.6% children belong to an ethnic 
        minority group. 
        The town council of Essen initiated the ‘Essen—City 
        for Children’ project in 1988. Cross-sectoral inputs 
        were sought while defining the objectives and multidisciplinary approach for an inclusive development 
        plan for the children of Essen. The Action Programme 
        for the project was launched in the year 1990. The 
        main focus of the programme was to develop a 
        manual to support initiatives of parents, develop 
        guidelines to influence the design and organisation 
        of open spaces and playgrounds, and to initiate a 
        child-friendly traffic network. 
        In 1994, information was drawn from various 
        disciplines on the situation of children and youth in 
        Essen. The outcome of this information collection 
        was the publication of the document ‘The State of 
        the Children in Essen’, which gave directions for 
        future policy development. In 1998, on account of 
        its unconventional and innovative way of tackling the 
        challenges of modern cities, the city of Essen was 
        invited by the Bertelsmann Foundation to collaborate 
        in the ‘Cities of Tomorrow’ network, an international 
        network comprising municipalities from around the 
        world that have promoted or implemented child– 
        friendly policies.</p>
        <p>The goal of the Essen—City for Children project is 
            to create conditions that would enable the children 
            of Essen to develop as healthy individuals who are 
            comfortable in their urban environment. The project 
            has adopted a cross-sectoral and multidisciplinary 
            approach, having many strategic partnerships 
            consisting of representatives from all sections of 
            the city that are involved with children and youth in 
            Essen.
            The four important stakeholders of the project 
            have a clear demarcation of roles and include the 
            Essen Town Council that initiated the project and 
            is responsible for directing the development of the 
            programme. The Children’s Office established in 
            1990 within the local youth and social affairs portfolio 
            to promote and develop governmental policies 
            for children, conducts regular surveys, forums 
            and consultations to increase child and family 
            participation. The Children’s Office acts as the ‘goto’ centre for all issues related to children in general 
            and also those related specifically to the project. It 
            promotes open spaces, child–friendly traffic zones 
            etc.
            The action committee of Essen—City for Children 
            consists of all stakeholders who are associated with 
            children and youth in Essen. The committee works 
            together to create a healthy and right environment for 
            children to develop as free spirited citizens. The work 
            of the committee is coordinated by the Children’s 
            Office which can streamline recommendations for 
            the policy makers.
            In an attempt to promote good parenting, Essen has 
            established a Family Point that provides information 
            on parenting to parents and also children. It also 
            acts as a feedback centre where parents can give 
            their opinions on how to make Essen more children 
            friendly. 
            Main Activities
            The Essen—City for Children project aims at 
            optimising the services available to children and 
            parents for the intellectual, cultural and physical 
            development of children. It promotes a culture of 
            ongoing dialogue and learning between the city 
            council, administration, non-municipal partners, 
            children and parents.
            In 1989, an attempt was made to transform the public 
            playgrounds into ecological play spaces. The Office</p>

      <h2>Key Features</h2>

      <p>One of the main tasks of the Youth Ambassadors is to 
        bring together different sub-cultures of the city to the 
        Culture Factory at the Hall of Fame. The city provides 
        a building to the youth to realise their dreams and 
        encourages their ideas through financial support. 
        Under the initiative, children can compose music, 
        dance, and organise music festivals etc.</p> </article>

      <h2>Evaluation</h2>

      <p>The well-being of children and youth and the 
        implementation of the youth policy is regularly 
        monitored. Through the community evaluations, 
        student surveys, and an inspection team of young 
        people the child friendliness of the city is measured 
        and assessed on how it improves the lives of children, 
        youth and parents. At the policy level, evaluations 
        of (pilot) programmes are undertaken and used to 
        improve new projects.</p> </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Future Challenges</h2>

      <p>One of the key concerns was to ensure that 
        bureaucratic processes are simple and faster so 
        as to keep children and youth motivated. In order 
        to ensure that the improvements envisaged under 
        the project do not slow down due to bureaucratic 
        processes, streamlined communication and 
        continuous monitoring is required between the 
        municipality and young people.</p>
