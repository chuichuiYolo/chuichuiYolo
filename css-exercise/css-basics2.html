      <h1>Key Features</h1>
      <p>Tilburg city promotes a number of youth initiatives 
        which are innovative and attract a range of young 
        people. The Youth Ambassador programme is 
        one such initiative in which young ambassadors 
        share their experiences of overcoming personal 
        challenges. It acts as a focal point for young people 
        and communicates issues to the municipality. 
        They act as representatives of the young people 
        in the decision-making process of the municipality 
        and are actively involved in activities organised by 
        and for young people. A united network of youth 
        ambassadors meets regularly to discuss issues 
        concerning young people.</p>
      <p>One of the main tasks of the Youth Ambassadors is to 
        bring together different sub-cultures of the city to the 
        Culture Factory at the Hall of Fame. The city provides 
        a building to the youth to realise their dreams and 
        encourages their ideas through financial support. 
        Under the initiative, children can compose music, 
        dance, and organise music festivals etc.</p>
      <h2>Future Challenges</h2>
  
      <p>One of the key concerns was to ensure that 
        bureaucratic processes are simple and faster so 
        as to keep children and youth motivated. In order 
        to ensure that the improvements envisaged under 
        the project do not slow down due to bureaucratic 
        processes, streamlined communication and 
        continuous monitoring is required between the 
        municipality and young people.</p>
